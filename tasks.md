# Task 1: Initial ML Pipeline Setup

## Objective

Set up the environment, fetch a real dataset, and build an initial working ML pipeline with the following components:

- Raw data ingestion
- Simple feature generation
- Model training & evaluation
- Log the result
- Confirm all steps run with real data

## Steps

- [x] Create Python virtual environment (`venv`)
- [x] Install required dependencies
- [x] Download a real dataset (LightGBM or Kaggle format)
- [x] Implement data ingestion module
- [x] Implement basic feature engineering
- [x] Implement model training and evaluation
- [x] Create logging system
- [x] Test full pipeline end-to-end
- [x] Document results and lessons learned

## Success Criteria

- All pipeline steps run with real data
- No mocked or simulated results
- Real metrics logged (AUC, logloss, accuracy)
- Pipeline is testable and repeatable
- Environment is properly isolated with venv

# Task 2: Improve Pipeline Robustness, Usability, and Documentation

## Objective

Make the pipeline more robust, user-friendly, and maintainable. This includes better error handling, CLI support, and improved documentation.

## Steps

- [x] Add CLI support to `main_pipeline.py` (dataset path, log level, etc.) _(in progress: argparse added, user can now specify --data-path and --log-level)_
- [x] Improve error handling and logging in all modules _(try/except blocks and traceback logging added to feature engineering and model training modules)_
- [x] Write and maintain `debug_logs.md` (log issues, fixes, debugging insights) _(created with error handling improvements documented)_
- [x] Document the pipeline in `README.md` (usage, overview, troubleshooting) _(comprehensive documentation added with installation, usage, CLI options, troubleshooting, and project structure)_
- [x] Refactor code for clarity and modularity _(added type hints, improved docstrings, constants, input validation, and better code organization to feature_engineering.py)_

## Success Criteria

- Pipeline can be run with CLI arguments
- All errors are logged with meaningful messages
- Debug logs and troubleshooting steps are documented
- Code is clean, modular, and well-documented
- README provides clear instructions and overview

## Task 2 Progress Log

- **2024-06-14**: Added CLI support to `main_pipeline.py` using `argparse`. Users can now specify `--data-path` and `--log-level` when running the pipeline. Log level is dynamically set for all handlers.
- **2024-06-14**: Improved error handling and logging in `feature_engineering.py` and `model_training.py`. All main methods now log errors and tracebacks, ensuring robust debugging and traceability.
- **2024-06-14**: Created `debug_logs.md` to document error handling improvements and provide troubleshooting insights.
- **2024-06-14**: Completely rewrote `README.md` with comprehensive documentation including installation instructions, usage examples, CLI options, pipeline architecture, troubleshooting guide, and project structure overview.
- **2024-06-14**: Refactored `feature_engineering.py` for improved clarity and modularity. Added type hints, comprehensive docstrings, constants for magic numbers, input validation, and better code organization. All functionality tested and verified to work correctly.

## Task 2 Summary

**Task 2 has been completed successfully!** All steps have been implemented and tested:

✅ **CLI Support**: Users can now run the pipeline with custom data paths and log levels  
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed logging and tracebacks  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with usage instructions and troubleshooting  
✅ **Debug Logs**: Maintained debug logs for future troubleshooting  
✅ **Code Quality**: Refactored code with type hints, validation, and better organization

The pipeline is now more robust, user-friendly, and maintainable, ready for the next iteration of improvements.

# Task 3: Advanced ML Capabilities and Production Readiness

## Objective

Enhance the ML framework with advanced capabilities including hyperparameter optimization, model persistence, inference pipeline, and production-ready features.

## Steps

- [ ] Implement hyperparameter optimization (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
- [ ] Add model persistence and loading capabilities (save/load trained models)
- [ ] Create inference pipeline for new data predictions

- [ ] Add configuration management (YAML config files)
- [ ] Create deployment-ready model serving capabilities

## Success Criteria

- Models can be optimized with hyperparameter tuning
- Trained models can be saved, loaded, and reused
- Inference pipeline works independently for new data
- Model versions are tracked and experiments are logged
- Pipeline is configurable via external config files
- Framework is ready for production deployment
