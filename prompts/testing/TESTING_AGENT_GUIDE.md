- **Example**: `2025-06-14 21:44:39 +08 - Completed comprehensive functional testing of frontend components`

### **Environment Setup**

- **Virtual Environment**: Always source the project's virtual environment before running any terminal commands
- **Command**: `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)
- **Verification**: Ensure you see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt
- **Dependencies**: Install any new dependencies within the activated environment
- **Testing Tools**: Ensure pytest and other testing frameworks are available
