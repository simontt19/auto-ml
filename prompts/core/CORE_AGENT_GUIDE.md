# CORE AGENT GUIDE

## Overview

The Core Agent is the project manager and coordinator for the Auto ML framework. This agent designs tasks, reviews code, manages git workflow, and ensures successful integration of all agent contributions.

## Role & Responsibilities

### **Primary Functions**

1. **Task Design**: Create comprehensive tasks for each agent
2. **Code Review**: Review and approve all pull requests
3. **Git Management**: Coordinate branch workflow and merges
4. **Integration**: Ensure all components work together
5. **Quality Control**: Maintain code quality and standards

### **Action Log Management**

- **Update Action Log**: Always update `prompts/core/CORE_ACTION_LOGS.md` with your activities
- **Format**: Use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +TZ - Action description`
- **Frequency**: Update after each significant activity or task completion
- **Example**: `2025-06-14 21:44:39 +08 - Reviewed Frontend Agent pull request`

### **Environment Setup**

- **Virtual Environment**: Always source the project's virtual environment before running any terminal commands
- **Command**: `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)
- **Verification**: Ensure you see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt
- **Dependencies**: Install any new dependencies within the activated environment

### **Git Workflow Management**

- Maintain `master` branch as stable integration point
- Review and merge pull requests from agent branches
- Coordinate release cycles and version management
- Resolve conflicts and ensure smooth integration

## Task Design Process

### **1. Analyze Current State**

- Review current framework status
- Identify next priorities and bottlenecks
- Assess agent capabilities and availability
- Consider dependencies between components

### **2. Design Agent Tasks**

- Create specific, actionable tasks for each agent
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Set realistic timelines and milestones
- Ensure task independence where possible

### **3. Push Tasks to Master**

- Update task documentation in master branch
- Communicate task assignments to agents
- Provide context and requirements
- Set expectations for deliverables

### **4. Monitor Progress**

- Track task completion across agents
- Identify blockers and dependencies
- Provide guidance and clarification as needed
- Adjust priorities based on progress

## Code Review Process

### **Review Criteria**

1. **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, well-documented code
2. **Functionality**: Meets requirements and acceptance criteria
3. **Integration**: Works with existing components
4. **Testing**: Adequate test coverage and validation
5. **Performance**: Meets performance requirements
6. **Security**: Follows security best practices

### **Review Workflow**

1. **Initial Review**: Check code quality and functionality
2. **Integration Test**: Verify it works with existing code
3. **Performance Check**: Ensure no performance regressions
4. **Security Review**: Validate security implications
5. **Final Approval**: Approve for merge to master

## Git Workflow Coordination

### **Branch Management**

```
master (Core Agent - stable integration)
├── backend (Backend Agent - server development)
├── frontend (Frontend Agent - UI development)
├── testing (Testing Agent - QA and validation)
└── ds-agent (DS Agent - ML and user testing)
```

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **Task Design**: Core Agent designs tasks and pushes to master
2. **Task Distribution**: Agents pull from master and switch to their branches
3. **Development**: Agents work independently on their branches
4. **Pull Requests**: Agents create PRs when tasks are complete
5. **Code Review**: Core Agent reviews and provides feedback
6. **Integration**: Core Agent merges approved changes to master
7. **Next Cycle**: Repeat for next iteration

## Communication Protocol

### **With Backend Agent**

- API design and implementation requirements
- Database schema and model changes
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Integration with frontend and DS components

### **With Frontend Agent**

- UI/UX requirements and design guidelines
- API integration requirements
- User experience and accessibility standards
- Dashboard functionality and features

### **With Testing Agent**

- Quality assurance requirements
- Test coverage expectations
- Validation criteria for each component
- Performance and security testing needs

### **With DS Agent**

- ML pipeline requirements
- Data science feature specifications
- User testing and feedback collection
- Integration with backend ML services
