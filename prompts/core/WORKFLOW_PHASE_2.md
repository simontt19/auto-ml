# PHASE 2 WORKFLOW - PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT

## Overview

Phase 2 implements a parallel development workflow where Frontend and Backend agents work simultaneously, followed by Testing and DS agents. This workflow maximizes efficiency while maintaining quality and coordination.

## Development Phases

### **PHASE 2A: PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT (Frontend + Backend)**

- **Agents**: Frontend Agent + Backend Agent
- **Goal**: Core functionality implementation
- **Execution**: Immediate parallel development

### **PHASE 2B: QUALITY ASSURANCE (Testing)**

- **Agent**: Testing Agent
- **Goal**: Comprehensive testing and validation
- **Execution**: Immediate testing after Phase 2A completion

### **PHASE 2C: ML INTEGRATION (DS Agent)**

- **Agent**: DS Agent
- **Goal**: ML capabilities and user testing
- **Execution**: Immediate ML integration after Phase 2B completion

## Git Branch Strategy

```
master (Core Agent - stable integration)
├── frontend (Frontend Agent - UI development)
├── backend (Backend Agent - server development)
├── testing (Testing Agent - QA and validation)
└── ds-agent (DS Agent - ML development)
```

## Communication Protocol

### **Continuous Updates**

- Each agent updates their action logs upon task completion
- Core Agent reviews all action logs and coordinates
- Issues and blockers are documented in debug logs

### **Pull Request Process**

1. Agent creates PR from their branch to master
2. Core Agent reviews and provides feedback
3. Agent addresses feedback and updates
4. Core Agent approves and merges to master
5. All agents pull latest changes from master

### **Issue Resolution**

- Issues documented in respective debug logs
- Cross-agent issues escalated to Core Agent
- Solutions documented for future reference

## Success Metrics

### **Phase 2A (Parallel Development)**

- Frontend and Backend features implemented
- API integration working
- Basic functionality complete

### **Phase 2B (Quality Assurance)**

- All features tested and validated
- Bug reports documented and addressed
- Performance benchmarks established

### **Phase 2C (ML Integration)**

- ML capabilities integrated
- User testing completed
- Platform ready for production

## Execution Strategy

- **Immediate Execution**: Agents execute tasks immediately upon assignment
- **Parallel Processing**: Frontend and Backend work simultaneously
- **Continuous Integration**: Each agent maintains their branch and creates PRs
- **Rapid Iteration**: Quick feedback loops and immediate issue resolution
- **Automated Coordination**: Core Agent manages integration and coordination

## Remember

- **Agent Speed**: Tasks can be completed rapidly by AI agents
- **Parallel Work**: Frontend and Backend can work simultaneously
