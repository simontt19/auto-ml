# AUTO-ML FRAMEWORK VISION

## MISSION

Build a self-evolving, enterprise-grade ML platform where data scientists are assisted by intelligent agents, and the platform continuously optimizes itself based on usage patterns.

## FINAL VISION

- **DS Agents** assist data scientists with ML project development
- **Architecture Agents** optimize the platform based on usage patterns
- **Platform** automatically evolves through intelligent analysis
- **Users** benefit from increasingly sophisticated ML experience

## CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT**: Each task builds upon previous ones
2. **REAL DATA USAGE**: Use actual datasets, not simulated data
3. **PRODUCTION READINESS**: Focus on deployment, scalability, maintainability
4. **MODULAR DESIGN**: Reusable components for different datasets
5. **INTELLIGENT EVOLUTION**: Platform continuously improves through agent analysis

## DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

- Break tasks into multiple steps with progress logging
- Use real data, avoid simulation/mocking
- Focus on production-ready features
- Always use project venv for testing
- Document troubleshooting in `prompts/debug_logs.md`
- Conduct periodic reviews and strategy updates

## TASK ROADMAP
