# Final Goal: Enterprise-Scale Auto ML Framework

## Vision Statement

Build a **comprehensive, enterprise-grade Auto ML framework** that can handle real-world scenarios with multiple users, projects, and massive scale. The framework should be **agent-friendly** for automated development and **user-friendly** for simple requirement specification.

## Target Scale & Use Cases
