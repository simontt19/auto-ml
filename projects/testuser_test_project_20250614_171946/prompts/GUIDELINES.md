```

### Documentation

- Each notebook should have a clear introduction and conclusion
- Code should be self-documenting with clear variable names
- Include comments for complex logic
- Document all assumptions and decisions

## Data Handling Requirements

### Data Quality

- Always check for missing values and outliers
- Validate data types and ranges
- Document any data quality issues found
- Create data quality reports for stakeholders

### Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values consistently across all features
- Use appropriate encoding for categorical variables
- Scale numerical features when necessary
- Create reproducible preprocessing pipelines

### Data Validation

- Validate input data before processing
- Check for data drift in production
- Monitor data quality metrics
- Implement data versioning

## Model Selection Criteria

### Performance Requirements

- Primary metric: Accuracy (target >85%)
- Secondary metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Cross-validation: 5-fold stratified CV
- Test set: 20% holdout with stratification

### Model Types to Consider

1. **Baseline Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
2. **Advanced Models**: XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Voting, Stacking, Bagging

### Model Selection Process

1. Start with simple baseline models
2. Compare performance across multiple algorithms
3. Consider interpretability requirements
4. Evaluate computational complexity
5. Test on validation set before final selection
