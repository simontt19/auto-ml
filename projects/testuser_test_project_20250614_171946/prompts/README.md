# Project: Adult Income Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on demographic and employment data.

## Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Develop a binary classification model for income prediction
- **Target Metric**: Achieve >85% accuracy on test set
- **Business Value**: Help organizations understand income patterns for targeted marketing

## Key Stakeholders

- **Data Scientist**: testuser
- **Business Owner**: Marketing team
- **End Users**: Marketing analysts

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Model accuracy > 85%
- [ ] Model interpretability for business insights
- [ ] Production-ready deployment
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Data exploration and preprocessing (Week 1)
- **Phase 2**: Feature engineering and model development (Week 2)
- **Phase 3**: Model optimization and validation (Week 3)
- **Phase 4**: Deployment and documentation (Week 4)

## Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Adult Income Dataset
- **Size**: ~48K records
- **Features**: 14 demographic and employment features
- **Target**: Binary income classification (>50K or <=50K)

## Constraints

- Must be interpretable for business stakeholders
- Should handle missing values gracefully
- Must be deployable in production environment
- Performance requirements: <2s prediction time
