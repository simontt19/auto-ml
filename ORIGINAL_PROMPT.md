# ORIGINAL PROMPT

## Objective

Build a comprehensive, production-ready machine learning framework that can handle multiple datasets and use cases, not just a single specific case. The framework should be well-organized, modular, and include proper deployment capabilities.

## Key Principles

1. **Iterative Development**: Each task should build upon the previous one, increasing complexity and robustness
2. **Real Data Usage**: Use actual datasets, not simulated data
3. **Production Readiness**: Focus on deployment, scalability, and maintainability
4. **Modular Design**: Create reusable components that can work with different datasets
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation and logs
6. **Periodic Review**: After completing several tasks, review outcomes, identify problems, and adjust the prompt with new information as needed

## Current Limitations to Address

1. **Single Use Case**: The current structure is only suitable for a specific case (Adult Income dataset)
2. **No Deployment Logic**: Missing production deployment capabilities
3. **Poor Organization**: The codebase is not well-organized for scalability
4. **Prompt Evolution**: The prompt should be updated based on learnings and identified gaps

## Action Guidelines

- Break each task into multiple steps
- Update tasks.md and add logs after completing each step
- Use real data and avoid simulation/mocking
- Focus on production-ready features
- After every few tasks, conduct a comprehensive review:
  - Identify what problems exist
  - Assess whether the current approach addresses the limitations
  - Update the prompt with new insights and requirements
  - Adjust the development strategy based on findings
- Ensure the framework can handle multiple datasets and use cases
- Include proper deployment and serving capabilities
- Maintain clean, modular, and well-organized code structure
